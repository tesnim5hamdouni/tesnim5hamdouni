<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Cybersecurity Projects</h2>

- <b>[Azure Sentinel](https://github.com/tesnim5hamdouni/SIEMxSentinel)</b>
  - Set up a honeypot in Azure and configured Azure Sentinel workbook to display global attack data (RDP brute force attacks) on a world map.
  - The logs were collected from Windows Event Viewer on the honeypot and were processed by a third-party API to extract geographic information. The data were then fed to the SIEM using a custom PowerShell script.
- <b>[Active Directory Home Lab](https://github.com/tesnim5hamdouni/AD-home-lab)</b>
  - Set up AD on server 2019 and use a PowerShell script to provision user accounts.</b></i>
- <b>[Nessus Vulnerability management]</b>
  - Install and configure Nessus Essentials on a VM
  - Implement vulnerability management function on sandbox networks following the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle (Discover, Prioritize Assets, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify) 
- <b>[DHCP spoofing attack](https://github.com/tesnim5hamdouni/DHCP-spoofing)</b>
  - Simulate a DHCP spoofing attack following 3 stages : DHCP starvation, usurpation and phishing.
- <b>[TCP SYN flooding attack](https://github.com/tesnim5hamdouni/TCP-SYN-flooding)</b>
  - Launch a TCP SYN flooding attack on a targeted server causing a denial of service to any legitimate client trying to connect.
- <b>[DNS hijacking](https://github.com/tesnim5hamdouni/DNS-Hijacking)</b>
  - The idea is to observe the traffic in the network using promiscuous mode, capture the DNS packets, parse them, build a reply and send it to the client before the authentic DNS server can.
